## EXE (created with py2exe) provided for easy demoing

**THIS BUILD DOES NTO INCLUDE THE LASTEST CHANGES BUT THEY DO NOT EFFECT OPERATION**

```whitelist.txt```&```config.txt```&```welcome_message.txt``` must all be in the same folder as the exe or it will not work

To make a new exe you must have pyinstaller:
```pip install pyinstaller```

Create a new build from the main app directory with:
```pyinstaller -i app.ico --name=receiver_zero --onefile main.py```
