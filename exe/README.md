## EXE (created with py2exe) provided for easy demoing

```whitelist.txt``` must be in the same folder as the exe or it will not work

To make a new exe you must have pyinstaller:
```pip install pyinstaller```

Create a new build from the main app directory with:
```pyinstaller main.py --onefile --name r_zero -i app.ico```
